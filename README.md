## 🔧 Troubleshooting & Support

### Common Issues & Solutions ⚠️

**🚫 Cannot Connect to Router**
- ✅ Verify the router IP address is correct and accessible from Home Assistant
- ✅ Confirm username and password credentials are valid
- ✅ Ensure `rpcd` and `uhttpd` services are running: `service rpcd status && service uhttpd status`
- ✅ Check firewall settings allow HTTP access to ubus (port 80/443)
- ✅ Test connectivity: `curl http://router_ip/ubus -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","method":"call","params":["00000000000000000000000000000000","session","login",{"username":"root","password":"your_password"}],"id":1}'`

**❌ No Devices Detected**
- ✅ Verify wireless software setting matches your OpenWrt configuration
- ✅ Check DHCP software setting corresponds to your DHCP server
- ✅ Ensure selected monitoring methods are properly configured on the router
- ✅ Test wireless detection: `iwinfo` or check hostapd status: `ubus call hostapd.wlan0 get_clients`
- ✅ Verify DHCP lease file accessibility: `ls -la /var/dhcp.leases /tmp/dhcp.leases`

**⏰ Sensors Not Updating**
- ✅ Check Home Assistant logs for connection errors: `Settings → System → Logs`
- ✅ Verify router permissions allow access to system information
- ✅ Test system data access: `ubus call system info && ubus call system board`

- ✅ Check that the rpcd service has been restarted after ACL configuration: `/etc/init.d/rpcd restart`
- ✅ Confirm the user account is assigned to the correct ACL group
- ✅ Test file access: `ubus call file read '{"path":"/tmp/dhcp.leases"}'`

**🚫 Device Kick Buttons Not Working**
- ✅ Verify hostapd is installed and running: `service hostapd status`
- ✅ Check hostapd ubus integration: `ubus list | grep hostapd`
- ✅ Ensure device kick buttons are enabled in integration configuration
- ✅ Confirm target device is connected via hostapd-managed interface
- ✅ Test hostapd control: `ubus call hostapd.wlan0 del_client '{"addr":"device_mac","reason":5,"deauth":true,"ban_time":60000}'`
